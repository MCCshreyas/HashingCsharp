# HashingCsharp
This is the project of simple hashing technique in Csharp programming language.
This program is of hashing without collison resolution technique. So data gets replaced with new data if the same hash value gets calculated
In this we take student ID as input and then calculate hash value from it and on array hash value index we save the phone number of the student.
